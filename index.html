      <h2>Kristian Mischke</h2>
      <p style="text-align: justify">Diligent student with over three years of experience in the industry. Enthusiastic
         about education and has enjoyed teaching programming basics to middle- and high-schoolers for the past 5 years.
         My degree focuses on Game Development and I have worked in the industry as a Junior Programmer for a couple
         years now and have worked on multiple game-jams and hobby projects. I am looking to eventually pursue a
         masterâ€™s degree in Computational Linguistics and build a career focused on Natural Language Processing (NLP)
         and Human Computer Interfaces (HCI).<!--I love learning languages and have achieved intermediate German fluency
         and want to bring that fluency higher and pursue other languages like Russian, ancient Greek, and a middle
         eastern language.--></p>
