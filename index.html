      <h3>Bio</h3>
      <p style="text-align: justify">Welcome to my sub-site where I store my Input Recalls and Lab assignments for the LING 360 class at UMBC!</p>
      <p style="text-align: justify">I am pursuing a Computer Science major (Game Development Track) and an Applied Linguistics minor at UMBC. I've been interested in video games and was dedicated to learning how they work since I was a kid. In middle school I started programming in basic drag-and-drop languages like <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/">Scratch by MIT</a> and then learned more complex text-based languages. I am most fluent in developing in C# and Unity, but I also program in Python, C++, and Java. I developed an interest for human languages in high school. That interest turned into an intrigue for linguistics when I started coming up with language learning app ideas. I went through many failed Google searches to finally learn about the terminology of Phonemes and Graphemes (See my prior blog post <a href="http://blog.kkcoder.net/2018/09/alphabetter.html">here</a>).</p>
