## Recall
This week we looked at various resources that discussed topics of how language and race interact in our society. Jonathan Rosa presented in his masterclass video many examples of how language is judged from a racial perspective. One of the examples that stood out to me the most was the class experiment where the same audio lecture was used with still images of different professional looking women (one of white descent, and one of asian descent). The results were that the class judged the lecture with the white woman's image as normal, unremarkable, and they performed well on the information recall afterwords... whereas the results of class for the lecture with the asian woman's image were judged as incomprehensible, and they performed less well on the listening comprehension test.

The study of police officer language towards citizens at traffic violation stops was rather interesting. The research was prompted due to prior studies that reported that black individuals reported less respectful language than white individuals during encounters with police authorities. They used various statistical methods to determine that there was a statistical significant difference in the language used towards white vs. black citizens. Furthermore they created computational linguistic models to determine quantitatively what language is used more with each people group. Testing against different covariant variables like officer race, or the result of the stop (warning, fines, etc.) did not have an effect on the results. This shows that there is a systemic issue in how citizens of different races are treated.

Linguistic Profiling is defined as denying goods or services based on one's accent or linguistic profile. John Baugh led multiple experiments on this topic. He and his peers found that call centers and landlords would respond differently based on the accent used. The advertisement calls for would deny services to Mexican or African American English based solely on their accent, but would grant said services to that of a more standard English accent.
