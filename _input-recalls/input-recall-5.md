## Recall p1
Both of these episodes primarily talked about the uses of he/him, she/her, and the singular they/them pronoun. The gender neutral they/them pronoun has been in use for hundreds of years (Shakespeare used them e.g.). They have more recently been gaining popularity in the English-speaking world since the LGBTQ movement. The videos discussed the psychological phenomenon of how pronouns must have a referent and there is agreement between them. The agreement is of grammatical gender (aka noun class). A minority of the worlds languages actually have grammatical gender distinctions in nouns although most of the romance languages do. Thus, a sentence is rendered ungrammatical if both "they/them" and "she/her" are used in a sentence and meant to refer to the same person (e.g. "she got her wallet our of her pocket" vs. "she got their wallet out of her pocket"). So psychologically there is a distinction, and a process that matches these words together systematically.

Other psychological phenomenon are taking place as well. Studies have shown using the N400 (a neuroscience test using EEGs) that on average the first impression a person has towards gender roles like man and woman is pretty predictable. They found that certain words and classes of words that have been culturally or historically associated with men or women have a quick neurological response as opposed to words that are generally prescribed to the other role. Some other interesting things to note are how the singular they/them is used when the gender role of a person is not important to the narrative, and then she/her or he/him will be used at points where the distinction is useful or important.

Personally I don't like to take on a prescriptivist view of language use, and I am against forcing people to use a specific gender pronoun--my view is it should be out of respect, not legality.
