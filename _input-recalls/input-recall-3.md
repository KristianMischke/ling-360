This week we read about how different social and other contexts affect how language is produced and perceived. There are many contexts that change the way someone speaks. Different registers (i.e. social contexts) with constituents may change how formal one's speech appears as compared to speaking with other peers. As discussed last time geolects also play a large role in the sounds of one's speech. Different people may consider the same sounds to have different connotations.

The reading presented the idea that as people age their language doesn't change muchâ€”and thus you can compare the older generation's language to the younger generation to observe how it changes... but then went on to show that this is not the case and that even the Queen of England has had changes in her vowel productions over time.

One example the reading pointed out was that by simply changing the way the /ing/ sound was pronounced, the listeners considered the speaker to be more or less intelligent.

An interesting phonetic detail that the reading pointed out was that the phrase "I don't know", depending on the context, can be reduced to something that resembles "n-n-n" accompanied by a shrug and a facial expression / eyebrow raise.

Over all this reading introduces the complexities that surround phonetic production and comprehension, and all the variables that go into both of those aspects of language. It's quite difficult to pin-point all the things that affect how one speaks or understands language.
