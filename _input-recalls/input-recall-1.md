title:  "Input Recall 1 - Baltimore Speak"
categories:
---
This week was an introduction to Sociolinguistics by looking at specific variations of language used in the Baltimore area. The main difference from the traditional pronunciation of 'Baltimore' were the 'Bawlmer' and 'Baldmore' variations. The group of locals who use 'Bawlmer' are more likely to call someone 'hon'. This variation of language is more typical of white blue-collar citizens, whereas the 'Baldmore' variation with interrogative 3PL words like 'yo' is more common to African American locals.

The first class also has these common linguistic traits:

- 'Water' pronounced /wuder/
- 'measure' pronounced /mayzure/
- distinction between cot and caught

The second class has these common linguistic traits:

- 'dog' pronounced /duhg/
- 'carry' pronounced /curry/
- 'area' pronounced /uh'rea/

Interesting to note is the different vowel shifts that are manifested in different regions of the United States. Some of the regions effected are much larger (e.g. the south) than others (the mid-north coastal cities).

Something the content addressed was the prejudices that come about with variations in language. Our prescriptivist roots deemed some pronunciations as 'better' than others which instilled false pretenses in the new generations. This is something that society is addressing more healthily now by accepting and learning from language differences instead of judging them.
