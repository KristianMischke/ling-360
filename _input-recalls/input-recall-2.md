## Recall
Last week we focused on the accents found in Baltimore, now we'll look at some other English varieties. There are many different varieties of English in the United States alone. Some of the factors that contribute to the differences are: socioeconomic status, race/ethnicity, trade contact, time a group spent in a location, and geographic boundaries to name a few. For example some regions of the U.S. are easier to enumerate the distinct qualities found in their accent compared to other regions. Areas on the east coast have been developing for longer periods of time compared to that of the west coast and thus there exist a larger variety of language varieties compared to the west. Additionally multiple varieties of African American English exist. These sprung from the English that the slaves had to learn and put together in the U.S.

Some varieties discussed include:

- Mouth smoothing in Philadelphia. Mouth smoothing is the phenomenon of pronouncing a diphthong as a single vowel. e.g. "place" as /prɑːs/ instead of /prɑɪs/
- Light l of latino English varieties. This is like Ls pronounced in "like" "little" "love" as opposed to a dark L as pronounced in "milk" or "chocolate"
