# Research Proposal Questions

1. What do you want to research?
   
    Personality and Language. Does (second) language affect personality? Can you predict personality from language?
   
1. How do you want to research this?
   
    Questionnaires, Computational Models.
   
1. Why do you want to research this?
   
    I think it would be useful to know if there is a connection between personality and language, and what that entails or implies regarding society.
   
1. What do you expect to find out by doing this research?
   
    A correlation between language use (either based on idiolectal lexicon, or based on language used) and personality (likely using the Big-Five OCEAN indicator)
   
1. What are the potential contributions and implications that we can infer from the results of this research?
   
    Does it aid in the argument for learning more languages? Does it show us that language variations are a reflection of culture or personality? Or does language in-part dictate personality?

1. How can you convert your research interests into a research question? What would they look like in the form of a research question?

    How does English language variation change Big-Five personality results?
