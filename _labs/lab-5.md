### How can we measure the concept of social class?
Acker (2006) outlined 4 aspects describing how to measure social class, they are:
1. Social interactions and institutions are active and occur in specific historical and geographical contexts.
    - e.g. Shaking hands as a greeting (social interaction) is perceived differently now during a pandemic vs. a year or two ago (historical context). 
2. Exploration of class from viewpoints other than the historically standard white male perspective.
    - e.g. Researching and understanding the POV of women or people of color in the workplace.
3. "Clarifying the meaning of gendering and racializing"
    - e.g. Defining these terms & analyzing the meaning in different social contexts.
4. Broadening the understanding of social economic class in the context of race and gender without a focus on production.
    - e.g. Defining and Researching social class not regarding income or type of job, but considering other qualities as well.
