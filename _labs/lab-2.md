My vowel chart seems to have higher F2 frequencies on average compared to the triangular chart listed [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vowel_diagram) but overall has the same general resemblance. This means that I produce my vowels closer to the front of my mouth.

Both acoustic and articulatory phonetics measure and study sounds produced (typically in language). Acoustic phonetics focuses on the physics of the sound (i.e. the frequencies and formants) whereas articulatory phonetics focuses on the articulation or positioning of the constituent parts of the vocal tract (i.e. tongue placement, lip rounding, nasality to name a few)

Terms:
- Frequency is how often the sound wave peaks. The Amplitude is the height of the sound wave.
- Sine waves are waves that fluctuate following a simple mathematical formula and produces a pure tone. Complex waves do not follow a simple formula, and can be constructed by combining many different variations of sine waves.
- Spectrograms are a graphical representation of energy at different frequency bands (y axis) over time (x axis). 
- Formants are high energy bands at certain frequencies.
- F0 is fundamental frequency which generally correponds to the way a person's voice sounds.
- F1 is the lowest formant measured. It generally corresponds to the size of the oral cavity under the pallatal region.
- F2 is the next highest formant measured. It generally corresponds to size of the oral cavity in the pharynx.

Questions:
- Is there research that focuses on how a person percieves different F1 and F2 values in a vowel? Does this chart looks different from their production chart?
