### Here are some different ways we've learned to categorize langauge variation:

- A Geolect is a variation of language categorized by linguistic features (phonetic, lexical, phraseology) and roughly bound by geographic location.
- A Sociolect is a variation of langauge categorized by linguistic features* and roughly bound by some social boundaries.
- An Idiolect is an individual's specific nuanced language variation.
- A Register is a mode of language determined by certain features that serve an important meaningful function in communication. Register includes differences in formality or relationship to the interlocutor (how you talk to your peers vs. your parents or professors) but also differences in physical proximity.
- Genre is a mode of langauge applied to an entire piece of language (e.g. a text, conversation) it could be the structure invoked (e.g. a sermon, academic lecture, poetic structures, songs)
- Style is a mode of language that applies to samples of language and is more aesthetically motivated.

### “Register exists alongside sociolects, geolects and idiolects. It complements them.”

This means that register (and it could also be argued the same for genre and style) is not mutually exclusive with socio-, geo-, and idio-lects. Formality can be present or absent in a geolect for example, and that formality may or may not look different compared to another given geolect...
