### Explaining the 5 tenets of raciolinguistics:
1. This field applies to situations where the differences in language among groups are due to a colonial background.
   - Both cases take place in the US.
1. Racism (as determined by cultural dominance) determines how language is perceived.
   - In the linguistic profiling, the outcome of the apartment availability was affected by the accent (audible perception) of the customer.
   - In the traffic stop study, the outcome of variance in respectful language was affected by the race (i.e. skin color, visual perception) of the civilian.
1. Language and races categorised and attracted into similar communities and society due to raciolinguistic enregisterment.
   - In both studies there were distinct divides in the communities that were affected.A native japanese speaker would mostly like to be attracted to another group that speak with an asian tongue compared to other languages.
1. Societal categories like race, gender, and SES constitute and affect a userâ€™s language and vice versa.
   - In the linguistic profiling study, the responses were based on preconceived notions about the races of the customers, and the language accent was the tool that  the companies used to judge that information about the customers.
   - The traffic stop study revealed a societal bias towards racial categories based on the language output of the police officers.
1. Undoing the damage of raciolinguistic attitudes cannot be done with prescriptivism of the affected groups. It can only be done by addressing the root causes of racism.
   - We should not attempt to solve the issue by telling speakers of AAE to code-switch when looking for apartments or analogous activities (or ever for that matter).
   - We should not simply instruct officers to only hide their disrespect. We should address where racism in the police comes from.


### What is the relation or connection between raciolinguistics and sociolinguistics? Is raciolinguisics sociolinguistics?

Raciolinguistics is a subset of sociolinguistics specifically concerned with linguistic differences and attitudes that result from race and racism. Also, sociolinguistics does not have a predetermined goal or set of guidelines, while the subject of raciolinguistics may come with reparative motivations.
